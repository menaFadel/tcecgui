TCEC GUI completely rewritten by octopoulos in Apr-May 2020.

Old version of the TCEC GUI is based on the work by Ben Reese and Arun Sathyamurthy,
forked from the [github.com/coolchess123/tceccutechess](https://github.com/coolchess123/tceccutechess)
repository. The original software was provided with the
[ISC](https://www.isc.org/licenses/) and
[Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses) licenses.

The source code is currently maintained by the TCEC organization. You
may reach us at the [TCEC Official discord](https://discord.gg/EYuyrDr) channel \#enginedev-lobby.
